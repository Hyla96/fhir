## [0.4.3]
* Thanks to [Luca](https://github.com/lucaspal) for these updates!
* Can now close the DB, delete the DB file, and sets completer to null (since the database method relies on this to be null to open a new database)
* Using fhir_db as local cache (updating resources but not increasing version #)
* Pass the mode to the ResourceDAO, so new cache related features can be introduced in the future, without changing the API of the existing methods (or without having to introduce a twin method for each operation).

I intentionally made the field optional to avoid breaking changes and bother existing users.
